# One-Minute Demo Video Script
## Anonymous Mental Health Platform - FHEVM Example

**Total Duration: 60 seconds**

---

## Scene 1: Introduction (10 seconds)

**[Show project title and README]**

Hello! This is the Anonymous Mental Health Platform - a comprehensive FHEVM example for the Zama December 2025 Bounty. This project demonstrates privacy-preserving healthcare using Fully Homomorphic Encryption on blockchain.

## Scene 2: Key FHEVM Concepts (30 seconds)

**[Open smart contract code]**

The contract showcases six critical FHEVM concepts:

**[Highlight encryption code]**
First, encrypted value storage using euint8 types to protect sensitive mental health data.

**[Highlight FHE.allowThis]**
Second, FHE.allowThis grants the contract permission to work with encrypted values.

**[Highlight FHE.allow]**
Third, FHE.allow enables selective access - only patients and counselors can decrypt the data.

**[Highlight emergency detection]**
Fourth, conditional logic triggers emergency alerts from encrypted thresholds without revealing actual values.

**[Show session management]**
Fifth, encrypted workflows manage complete counseling sessions with privacy.

**[Show input validation]**
Sixth, input validation before encryption prevents invalid data storage.

## Scene 3: Tests and Automation (15 seconds)

**[Run tests in terminal]**

```bash
npm test
```

**[Show test results]**

The test suite includes twenty comprehensive tests covering all FHEVM patterns. The project includes automation scripts for generating new examples and GitBook documentation.
