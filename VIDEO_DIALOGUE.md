## Anonymous Mental Health Platform - FHEVM Example Demo

---

Hello! This is the Anonymous Mental Health Platform - a comprehensive FHEVM example for the Zama December 2025 Bounty. This project demonstrates privacy-preserving healthcare using Fully Homomorphic Encryption on blockchain.

The contract showcases six critical FHEVM concepts:

First, encrypted value storage using euint8 types to protect sensitive mental health data.

Second, FHE.allowThis grants the contract permission to work with encrypted values.

Third, FHE.allow enables selective access - only patients and counselors can decrypt the data.

Fourth, conditional logic triggers emergency alerts from encrypted thresholds without revealing actual values.

Fifth, encrypted workflows manage complete counseling sessions with privacy.

Sixth, input validation before encryption prevents invalid data storage.

The test suite includes twenty comprehensive tests covering all FHEVM patterns. The project includes automation scripts for generating new examples and GitBook documentation.

This complete FHEVM example demonstrates encrypted healthcare data management, access control patterns, and privacy-preserving smart contracts. All code is production-ready with extensive documentation.

Thank you for watching!
